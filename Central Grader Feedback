Great work on completing this Project. 
You answered all the questions correctly. I would like you to go through the question "Do you have an intermediate certificate? 
If so, what is it?" again as I can see your web application has an Intermediate certificate "Microsoft Azure RSA TLS Issuing CA 07" I particularly liked you researched on HPP attack, and how the attacker can trick the application in gaining unauthorised access to data. 
Keep up the good work!
