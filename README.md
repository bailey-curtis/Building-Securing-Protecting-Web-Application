# Building, Securing & Protecting a Web Application
<h2>Brief</h2>
The following project showcases our first in-class project during our 6 month bootcamp. We were tasked to build, secure, and protect a cloud application that hosts our own cyber blog. 
To do this we used Azure labs to create our own domain and used various tools such as HTML editing and SSH authentication to edit and manipulate the web page for our assignmnet. A technical brief was also submitted which showcases my knowledge and understanding behind
various web development and web securing fundamentals.
